# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

This is the first Python program I ever built — a fun and visual **turtle race simulation** using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics and `random` libraries.

🎮 Multiple turtles race across the screen, each moving forward randomly.  
The first turtle to cross the finish line wins!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Multiple turtles are drawn on a graphical window.
- Each turtle moves forward by a random number of pixels.
- The race continues in a loop until one turtle reaches the finish line.
- A winner is declared based on who gets there first.

---

## 🐍 Built With

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` (built-in GUI graphics library)
- `random` (built-in Python library)

## 🖥️ Run It Locally

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mody-18/Import-Turtle.git
   cd Import-Turtle
3. Run the script:
  python turtle_race.py
